<p>Hi <%= @publisher.display_name %>, </p>
<p>Someone tried to buy your sheet, <%= link_to @sheet.title, sheet_url(@sheet) %> but was unable to continue because <strong>it's out of stock!</strong>
</p>
<p>Acquire more licenses from the publisher and update your purchase limits to continue selling <%= @sheet.title %>! Visit your works dashboard once you've acquired more licenses.
